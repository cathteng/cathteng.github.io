At 10:40PM on July 4, 2024, I decided to revive my personal website with this theme.

I had already been tinkering with new (free) Jekyll themes that support GitHub Pages for a few hours, but most of them were blog-focused and I wanted something with page support to put the cool things I've done.

Then, as I'm scrolling down, I come across <a href="https://github.com/riggraz/no-style-please">`no-style-please`</a>.

I love the simplistic look of it. It hasn't been updated in 3 years so some of the gems are outdated, and I have to use an older version of GitHub Pages, but this totally satisfies my aesthetic and logistical needs.

My previous website used <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">`al-folio`</a>, but since changing GitHub usernames, the site had gone down since it was served at the github.io of my previous username. I struggled to get it back up with the same theme and the re-installation wasn't easy. They recommend Docker containers which I don't think is necessary for what looks like a simple website! They don't recommend the `bundle exec jekyll serve` method of development anymore, either. But this theme does!

Anyways, I'm very happy with this new theme. I've ported over all the important things from my old site, added a few new things, and written this post. Hopefully I will have more things to share in the future.
