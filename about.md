Hello! My name is Cathy.

I'm a software developer and swammer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I studied computer science at Princeton University and am working towards a master's in the same discipline at Georgia Tech.

Swimming was my personality for a very long time, and I still geek out about the latest and greatest over at <a href="https://swimswam.com/">SwimSwam</a>. I'm now also trying to hone my land sport abilities (difficulty rating: 5/5), spend more time amongst the trees, and put my nose in more books.
